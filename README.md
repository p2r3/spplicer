# Spplicer
Convenient and straightforward [Spplice](https://p2r3.com/spplice/) package creation.

### Built on NeutralinoJS
To keep things lightweight, this project uses [NeutralinoJS](https://neutralino.js.org) for the web-based UI and for the API that helps manage the file system and Tar. In short, Neutralino is similar to Electron. But instead of bundling a whole browser, it relies on what's already present on the user's system.

### Contributing
To contribute, all you need is Git, Neutralino, Steam, Portal 2 and, of course, Spplice.

Assuming you've already installed Neutralino on your system, clone the repository and do `neu update` to fetch the required binaries. Then you can do `neu run` to ensure that everything works properly.
